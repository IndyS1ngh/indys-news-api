# Northcoders News API

To run this project locally, you will need to add two files: '.env.test' & '.env.development'.
Each of these files needs their respective environment variables in order to connect to the databases.
These are: "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test" for '.env.test' and "PGDATABASE=nc_news" for '.env.development'.
